- use seperate thread to check meals? >> NOT NECESSARY

- 1 mutex per variable, per function, per piece of code? >> PER VARIABLE

- custom usleep or not? >> YES




- arg limits ?

- do you need thread_detach ?

- if a philo dies, does the program stop immediately?

- will l_fork point to the first fork in the for array here : 	
philo[i].l_fork = &prog->forks[i];
philo[i].r_fork = &prog->forks[(i + 1) % data->n_philo];

- can you static a function that uses a common mutex?
