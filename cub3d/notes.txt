1. INIT game (store textures in buf) + PARSE map

2. RAY CASTING
    - calculate ray direction
    - calculate delta distance
    - calculate Step and Initial Side Distances
    - Performing Digital Differential Analysis
    - calculate Wall Height

3. RENDERING
    > handle textures
    - calculate each pixel for a given ray
    > use mlx_new_image + mlx_get_data_addr
    > assign RGB value to a pixel (assign the colour to the pixel in the image buffer, and then draw the whole image to the screen at once)

4. Player MOVEMENT

INFO :
- NO : north texture
- SO : south texture
- WE : west texture
