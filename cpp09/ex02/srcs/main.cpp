- ARG = positive integer sequence
- sort with merge-insert sort algorithm
    > use the Ford-Johnson algorithm

- if error : std::cerr << "" std::endl;
- choose how to manage duplicates

- use at least 2 different containers
    > implement your algorithm for each container and thus to avoid using a generic function
- handle at least 3000 different integers


DISPLAY 
• On the first line you must display an explicit text followed by the unsorted positive integer sequence.
• On the second line you must display an explicit text followed by the sorted positive integer sequence.
• On the third line you must display an explicit text indicating the time used by
your algorithm by specifying the first container used to sort the positive integer sequence.
• On the last line you must display an explicit text indicating the time used by
your algorithm by specifying the second container used to sort the positive integer sequence.
    > indicate the time used to perform all your operations, both the sorting part and the data management part
    > The format for the display of the time used to carry out your sorting
is free but the precision chosen must allow to clearly see the difference between the two containers used

std::vector
std::deque ?
